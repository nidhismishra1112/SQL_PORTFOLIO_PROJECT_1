# SQL_PORTFOLIO_PROJECT_1
 Title: COVID Data Exploration: SQL Portfolio Project

Description:

In this SQL portfolio project, I have developed a data exploration project based on live COVID-19 data. The project showcases my proficiency in SQL skills, ranging from basic to advanced level, by utilizing various SQL functions, including window functions, DML, DDL, views, joins, group by, and order by, to analyze and manipulate the data related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The project involves working with real-world data, specifically data related to COVID-19, which may include information such as daily cases, deaths, hospitalizations, testing data, and demographic information. The goal of the project is to gain insights into the patterns and trends in the COVID-19 data using SQL functions and techniques.

The tasks involved in the project may include data aggregation, filtering, sorting, joining, and transforming the data using SQL queries. Basic SQL functions such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements may be used for data manipulation, while DDL statements may be used for creating, modifying, and managing database objects such as tables, views, and indexes. Advanced SQL concepts such as window functions may be employed to perform complex calculations and analysis on the data, while views may be created to simplify complex queries and improve query performance. Additionally, JOINs and GROUP BY clauses may be utilized for combining and summarizing data, and ORDER BY clauses may be used for sorting data based on specific criteria.

The project may also demonstrate the use of various SQL functions, including but not limited to aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, AVG, COUNT), string functions (e.g., CONCAT, SUBSTRING), date and time functions (e.g., DATEADD, DATEDIFF), logical functions (e.g., IFNULL, CASE), and window functions (e.g., ROW_NUMBER, RANK).
